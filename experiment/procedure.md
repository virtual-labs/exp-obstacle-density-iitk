1.Monte Carlo Simulation has been used in this experiment in which dynamic variables are updated at each time interval with random numbers to study the microscopic and dynamic behavior of systems. Here we have used stochastic cellular automation in which each element is characterized by strength parameter 's' and slip probability. Load shedding principles i.e. load transfer to neighboring sites when slip occurs is considered.<br>
2.The model assumes that for small strain regime and materials with low hardening rates strain hardening and recovery processes can be ignored, that materials respond to plastic deformation in the same way because the observed behavior is due to a large number of discrete events coupled through load transfer, and that obstacle density and its behavior does not change during the deformation process.
